@article{Himi,
	abstract = "Recent advanced techniques for the reconstruction of three-dimensional (3D) images allow further visual recognition of the fine structures of the temporal bone. We demonstrate the advantages of reconstruction 3D imaging in helical CT scans of the normal temporal bone and in patients who have received cochlear implants. After the temporal bone was scanned in the axial plane in the helical scan mode, the data were transferred to a workstation and 3D reconstruction was performed. The normal temporal bone structures were well recognized on these 3D images. The spatial relationship between the lymphatic space of the inner ear and the electrode array is visible. This method provides a detailed anatomy of the insertion of the electrodes into the cochlea and provides precise images of electrode routes by means of varying the angles of view on the computer display. Individual electrodes could not be distinguished. The information from 3D images may be useful not only for pre- but also postoperative investigations in cochlear implantation.",

@article{Muller,

The algorithm runs in timeO (n log n), where n is the sum of the numbers of vertices of the two polyhedra. The part of the algorithm concerned with (iii) (constructing the intersection) is based upon the fact that if a point in the intersection is known, then the entire intersection is obtained from the convex hull of suitable geometric duals of the two polyhedra taken with respect to this point.",
