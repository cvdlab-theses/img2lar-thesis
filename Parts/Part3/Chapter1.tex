From this chapter, our attention will be focused on the application realized for this work. Its purpose is to extract three-dimensional models from medical images in a efficient way, trying to reduce the memory occupation as much as possible. In particular, in this chapter we will see the application architecture and the ideas at the basis of its behavior; later we will examine in detail the algorithms used

\section{Introduction to the application}\label{sec31:introduction}

How we have seen above, the application described in this work, which is called \textbf{ImagesToLARModel}, has the aim to produce three-dimensional models from medical images. In Chapter~\ref{Chapter13} and Chapter~\ref{Chapter14}, we have seen that there are many techniques for producing these models. However they have some inconvenience, for example they can be slow or produces only approximated models. In particular, when dealing with huge volumes of data, people use iso-surfaces with the marching cubes algorithm so our comparisons will be done with it.\\

Now we can talk about our technique. How we have seen in Chapter~\ref{Chapter22}, a three-dimensional model can be represented using the LAR representation schema. Its advantages are the small space required for memorization and the speed provided by algorithms based on topological algebra. In addition the LAR schema is \textbf{topologically correct}, so we are sure that the resulting model is \textit{perfectly correspondent to the given data}. We can be sure of this assumption because it is proved by the topological theory, that provides us a great foundation for all possible practical applications. Moreover this means that LAR schema is \textit{independent from the shape} of the complex, so using the same algorithm we can process whichever model (even with holes).\\

How we can see in \cite{Paoluzzi}, in the past had already been developed a first prototype for the extraction of three-dimensional models from images. However that application was not specifically designed for a parallel environment, so it was not able to manage models so big that they cannot enter in memory. ImagesToLARModel can solve this problem using parallel algorithms applied to the LAR schema. In next sections we will see how to do this.

\section{Distributing the model in a grid}\label{sec31:Grid}

How we have seen earlier, ImagesToLARModel is able to exploit a parallel architecture for extracting models from medical images. In particular we are focused on a \textit{cluster environment}. The strategy adopted for the problem decomposition among all processes is very simple. In fact, it is sufficient to draw a grid on our images and distribute the resulting images \textbf{blocks} to all processes. After a progressive refinement, the blocks are then merged obtaining the final three-dimensional representation in the \textit{wavefront obj} format.

   \caption[The grid used for parallel computation]{The grid used for parallel computation. (a) 2D grid on a single image (b) 3D grid for the stack of images}
   \label{fig:grid}
\end{figure}

Now we can give the following definitions, which will be used in next parts of this thesis:

\begin{itemize}
 \item \textbf{Grid:} is the subdivision of the entire stack of images, with sizes defined by the user.
 \item \textbf{Block:} is a single cell of the grid
 \item \textbf{blockDx, blockDy, blockDz:} are the dimensions of a single block
 \item \textbf{xBlock:} is the x-coordinate of a block
 \item \textbf{yBlock:} is the y-coordinate of a block
 \item \textbf{zBlock:} is the z-coordinate of a block
\end{itemize}

\textit{xBlock} and \textit{yBlock} are defined on a single image, while \textit{zBlock} is defined on different images; in the application it is also referred with the terms \textbf{StartImage} and \textbf{EndImage}, which indicate the first image and the last image of that block respectively.\\

So, we can see that every single processes now transform only a single block at time (which will contain at most blockDx $\times$ blockDy $\times$ blockDz voxels). Obviously the dimension of a block can be set by the user according to the image sizes and the characteristics of the computing infrastructure.

\section{Exposed functionalities of the application}\label{sec31:Functionalities}

Now we can focus on the architecture of the application. We have already said that our application need to take a stack of medical images and produce a three-dimensional representation. Thus this has been divided into two main parts, the first manipulate the stack using image processing techniques while the second does the conversion process.

So our application will expose two functions:
\begin{itemize}
 \item \texttt{prepareData}: take a folder with the stack of images and write on disk the same images after manipulations (filtering, clustering, etc\dots)
 \item \texttt{convertImagesToLARModel}: take the folder with the pre-processed images and converts them to the final model
\end{itemize}

These two exposed functions have the responsibility to call all the modules used by the software and both work with JSON configuration files. A full explanation of the parameters and their meaning will be introduced in the next chapters.\\

Now we can see the modules used:
\begin{itemize}
 \item \textbf{ImagesToLARModel.jl}: it is the main module for the software, which takes input parameters and start images conversion and does the image processing
 \item \textbf{ImagesConversion.jl}: it is called by \texttt{ImagesToLARModel.jl} module and controls the entire conversion process calling all other modules
 \item \textbf{GenerateBorderMatrix.jl}: it generates the boundary operator for grid specified in input, saving it in a JSON file
 \item \textbf{PngStack2Array3dJulia.jl}: it is responsible of all functions involving images
 \item \textbf{Lar2Julia.jl}: it contains a small subset of LAR functions written in Julia language
 \item \textbf{LARUtils.jl}: it contains utility functions for manipulation of LAR models
 \item \textbf{Smoother.jl}: it contains function for smoothing of LAR models
 \item \textbf{Model2Obj.jl}: it contains function that can read and write obj models
\end{itemize}
